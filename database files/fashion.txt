Early Western travelers, whether to Persia, Turkey, India, China, would frequently remark on the absence of change in fashion there.
The Japanese Shogun's secretary bragged (not completely accurately) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years.
However, there is considerable evidence in Ming China of rapidly changing fashions in Chinese clothing.
Changes in costume often took place at times of economic or social change, as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate, followed by a long period
 without major changes. In 8th-century Moorish Spain the musician Ziryab introduced to C?rdoba sophisticated clothing-styles based on seasonal and daily 
fashions from his native Baghdad, modified by his own inspiration. Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the 
Turks, who introduced clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East.

The beginning in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated. 
Historians, including James Laver and Fernand Braudel, date the start of Western fashion in clothing to the middle of the 14th century.
The most dramatic early change in fashion was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment from calf-length to barely covering the buttocks,
sometimes accompanied with stuffing in the chest to make it look bigger. This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers.

The pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair,
became equally complex. Art historians are therefore able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years,
particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had
previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles.
These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again,
mostly originating from Ancien R?gime France. Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of early modern Europe led to the
bourgeoisie and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites – a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main
motors of changing fashion.
